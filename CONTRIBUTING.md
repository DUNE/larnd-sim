# Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. Feel free to open a PR with the changes you propose. Just few guidelines.
- Please make PRs into the develop branch. This branch will periodically be merged into the main branch when it is deemed sufficiently stable.
- We aim to follow [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) guidelines. We try to follow `this_convention` and not `thisConvention`, but we are flexible. After all _A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds_.
- For the docstrings we follow [Google convention](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
- Please don't open a PR from your master branch, since it creates [a series of problems](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).

That's all! Thanks for contributing!
